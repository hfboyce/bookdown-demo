I need to just make this clear that this is the more important part of my whole book. I am a vegan which people find annoying but honestly it’s not that bad. I like: Baking pies Eating out at restaurants Eating at home Eating at school Eating at work Eating cookies Eating chips I think you get the idea that I love food and it fills that void in my cold empty heart 4.1 Popcorn I think it’s important that everyone knows I like truffle salt popcorn 4.2 Avocado And like any good vegan, I survive off avocados "]
